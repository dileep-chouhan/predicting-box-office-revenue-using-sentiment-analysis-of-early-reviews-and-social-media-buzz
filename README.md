# Predicting Box Office Revenue using Sentiment Analysis of Early Reviews and Social Media Buzz

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for box office revenue based on sentiment analysis of early film reviews (e.g., from Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic) and social media buzz (e.g., Twitter, Reddit).  The analysis explores the correlation between pre-release sentiment and subsequent box office performance, providing insights into the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and offering a potential tool for optimizing marketing spend and forecasting future film releases' revenue.  The model leverages various machine learning techniques to predict revenue based on the aggregated sentiment scores.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Tweepy (for Twitter data, if applicable)  
* NLTK (for Natural Language Processing, if applicable)


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.  Then, install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   *Note:*  You may need to adjust paths to data files within `main.py` if your data is not structured identically to the project's example.


## Example Output

The script will print key findings of the analysis to the console, including details about the model's performance metrics (e.g., R-squared, RMSE).  Additionally, the script will generate several visualization files (e.g., scatter plots showing the correlation between sentiment and box office revenue, bar charts comparing sentiment across different films) in the `output` directory.  These visualizations will aid in understanding the relationship between sentiment and box office success.  Example output files include: `sentiment_analysis.png`, `revenue_prediction.png`, `model_performance.png` (These filenames are examples and may vary).


## Data

This project requires a dataset containing movie titles, release dates, box office revenue, and early review/social media sentiment scores.  The data used in this specific project is not included in this repository for [Reason - e.g., size constraints, privacy concerns, licensing].  However, the code is structured to be adaptable to different datasets with a similar structure.  Example data schemas are available in the `data/example` directory.
